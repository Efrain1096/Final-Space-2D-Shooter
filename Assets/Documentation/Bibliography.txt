Sprites: 


All sprites are original and drawn by me (ships, projectiles, engine afterburner, button sprites, etc...), the ship sprite designs, especially the player's is inspired by the forward wing-swept design from one of the planes of Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception. The XR-45 Cariburn/Caliburn (https://acecombat.fandom.com/wiki/XR-45_Cariburn). Played the hell out of that game on the PSP.

Background Art: Original and drawn by me (Efrain Vasques \^.^/)

Splashscreen logo: Made by freelogodesign.org
